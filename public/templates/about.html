    <p>Kurves is a project for the Web and Mobile course at KaHo Sint-Lieven. It's a game where a player controls a
        kurve, which leaves a deadly trail.</p>

    <p>It's heavily based on <a href="http://curvefever.com/">Curvefever</a>, but instead of keyboard controls, one controls his kurve using a  mobile device.</p>

    <p>Implementation by Pieter Van Molle.</p>
